I am the main author of open source programs [Knights](http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php/Knights?content=122046) and [Opeke](http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php/Opeke?content=76417), both written in C++ using Qt and KDE libraries. 
I have contributed to several other KDE programs, the most to KDevelop and Cantor. 
Additionally, I wrote a visualization module for the data mining program [Orange](http://orange.biolab.si/) in Python. 
I have two Android applications, [Personal Volume](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noughmad.personalvolume) and [Slashdot Comments](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noughmad.slashdotcomments), published on the Play Store. 

As a computational physics student, I have written many numerical simulations for school projects, which are all available [online](https://github.com/Noughmad/Sola). 
As part of my PhD thesis, I am currently modeling the propagation of light through liquid crystals.
