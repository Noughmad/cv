Curriculum Vitae

as of October 2013

I was born on April 10, 1989 in Postojna, Slovenia, and started elementary school in Ljubljana, Slovenia in 1996. While in elementary school, I took part in knowledge competitions from various fields. I received several nationwide recognitions, including first places at national competitions in physics, chemistry, logic and computer programming.

After completing the elementary school in 2004, I enrolled into Gimnazija Bezigrad, a highly-regarded local high school. I was awarded the Slovenian national scholarship for gifted students, which I am still receiving now. While in high school, I focused mostly on mathematics and physics, where I participated in both national and international competitions. In the summer of 2007, I attended the International Mathematical Olympiad in Hanoi, Vietnam, where I received a bronze medal. The following year, in 2008, I attended the International Physical Olympiad, which also took place in Hanoi, and I again received a bronze medal. In the same year, I attended the International Linguistics Olympiad in Slanchev Bryag, Bulgaria.

I graduated from high school in 2008 and started studying physics at the Faculty of mathematics and physics, University of Ljubljana. In 2011, I completed the first Bologna cycle and enrolled into the second-cycle programme of Computational physics. I finished the programme and received the Master's degree in 2013. During the study, I spent three summers writing free software as part of the Google Summer of Code programme. For my work on one of these projects, a data mining program called Orange, I received a national award for contribution to sustainable devepment of society, given to students with exceptional achievements. At the moment I am PhD student with prof. Slobodan Žumer. My work is about numerical simulations of the propagation of light through liquid crystal structures.

My mother tongue is Slovene, but I am also fluent in English.
