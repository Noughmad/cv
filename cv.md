Curriculum Vitae

as of March 2013

I was born on April 10, 1989 in Postojna, Slovenia, and started elementary school in Ljubljana, Slovenia in 1996. While in elementary school, I took part in knowledge competitions from various fields. I received several nationwide recognitions, including first places at national competitions in physics, chemistry, logic and computer programming. 

After completing the elementary school in 2004, I enrolled into Gimnazija Bezigrad, a highly-regarded local high school. I was awarded the Slovenia national scholarship for gifted students, which I am still receiving now. While in high school, I focused mostly on mathematics and physics, where I participated in both national and international competitions. In the summer of 2007, I attended the International Mathematical Olympiad in Hanoi, Vietnam, where I received a bronze medal. The following year, in 2008, I attended the International Physical Olympiad, which also took place in Hanoi, and I again received a bronze medal. In the same year, I attended the International Linguistics Olympiad in Slanchev Bryag, Bulgaria. 

I graduated from high school in 2008 and started studying physics at the Faculty of mathematics and physics, University of Ljubljana. In 2011, I completed the first Bologna cycle and enrolled into the second-cycle program of Computational physics. I spent two summers working on free software as part of the Google Summer of Code programme. For my work on one of these projects, a data mining program called Orange, I received an award for contribution to sustainable devepment of society, given to students with exceptional achievements. 

At the moment I am writing my master's thesis for the completion of the second Bologna cycle under the mentorship of prof. Slobodan Žumer. My work is about numerical simulations of the propagation of light through liquid crystal structures. After receiving the master's degree this year, I plan to continue my work with prof. Žumer as a PhD student, keeping my focus on computer simulations of liquid crystals.
