I was born on April 10, 1989 in Postojna, Slovenia, and started elementary school in Ljubljana, Slovenia in 1996. While in elementary school, I took part in knowledge competitions from various fields. I received several nationwide recognitions, including first places at national competitions in physics, chemistry, logic and computer programming. 

After completing the elementary school in 2004, I enrolled into Gimnazija Bezigrad, a highly-regarded local high school. While in high school, I focused mostly on mathematics and physics, where I participated in both national and international competitions. In the summer of 2007, I attended the International Mathematical Olympiad in Hanoi, Vietnam, where I received a bronze medal. The following year, in 2008, I attended the International Physical Olympiad, which also took place in Hanoi, and I again received a bronze medal. In the same year, I attended the International Linguistics Olympiad in Slanchev Bryag, Bulgaria. 

I graduated from high school in 2008 and started studying physics at the Faculty of mathematics and physics, University of Ljubljana. In 2011, I completed the first Bologna cycle and enrolled into the second-cycle program of Computational physics. One summer break I worked as a student at the local Jozef Stefan institute. After that, I spent two summers working on free software as part of the Google Summer of Code programme.
